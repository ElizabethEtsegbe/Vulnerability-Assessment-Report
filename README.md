**Scope:** 
Lamai Corporation requested a vulnerability assessment to identify potential security weaknesses within its IT infrastructure and applications. The assessment will focus on internal network systems and web applications.

**Approach:**
The objective of this assessment is to identify vulnerabilities that may pose a risk to the organization's data security, compliance, and overall business continuity. The assessment will provide insights into areas that require immediate attention and remediation.


## Risk Assessment

| Threat Source | Threat Event                        | Likelihood | Severity | Risk |
|---------------|------------------------------------|------------|----------|-----|
| Insider       | Unauthorized data access            | 3          | 4        | 12  |
| External      | Malware infection                   | 2          | 3        | 6   |
| Employee      | Social engineering attack           | 1          | 4        | 4   |

### Approach

The risk assessment considered potential threats to the corporate network, including insider threats, external threats, and social engineering attacks. The likelihood of each threat event was evaluated, along with its potential severity. The risk assessment provides insights into potential vulnerabilities and their impact.

### Findings

#### Internal Network Systems

1. **Critical Vulnerability:** Outdated Software
   - Description: Several servers and workstations are running outdated operating systems and software, making them vulnerable to known exploits.
   - Recommendation: Implement a patch management process to regularly update and patch all systems to protect against known vulnerabilities.

2. **High-severity Vulnerability:** Weak Password Policies
   - Description: Users within the organization are using weak and easily guessable passwords, which may lead to unauthorized access.
   - Recommendation: Enforce strong password policies and conduct employee training on password security best practices.

3. **High-severity Vulnerability:** Lack of Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
   - Description: The absence of an IDS makes it challenging to detect and respond to potential intrusions and security incidents.
   - Recommendation: Implement an IDS to monitor network traffic and detect anomalies and suspicious activities.

#### Web Applications

4. **Critical Vulnerability:** Unpatched Web Application
   - Description: A critical vulnerability was identified in the organization's customer portal, allowing attackers to potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive customer data.
   - Recommendation: Immediately patch the web application to address this vulnerability and conduct a security review.

5. **High-severity Vulnerability:** Inadequate Input Validation
   - Description: The web application lacks proper input validation, making it susceptible to SQL injection attacks.
   - Recommendation: Implement input validation controls and conduct code review to identify and remediate vulnerabilities.

### Legal Considerations

Our legal counsel, Sarah Johnson, has reviewed the findings and confirmed that the organization is legally obligated to address the identified vulnerabilities to ensure compliance with data protection laws and industry regulations.

### Remediation Plan

Lamai Corporation is strongly advised to take immediate action to address the identified vulnerabilities. A comprehensive remediation plan should include the following steps:

1. Prioritize and address critical vulnerabilities within one week.
2. Implement a patch management process to keep systems and software up-to-date.
3. Enforce strong password policies and provide employee training.
4. Deploy an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to monitor network traffic.
5. Conduct a security review of the web application and patch the critical vulnerability.
6. Implement proper input validation controls in web applications.
7. Monitor and assess security controls regularly.

### Conclusion

The vulnerability assessment has provided critical insights into Lamai Corporation's security posture. It is essential to promptly address the identified vulnerabilities to safeguard sensitive data, maintain compliance, and ensure business continuity.

This report serves as a foundation for improving the organization's cybersecurity measures and strengthening its resilience against potential threats.
